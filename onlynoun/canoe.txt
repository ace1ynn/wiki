CANoe is a development and testing software tool from Vector Informatik GmbH. The software is primarily used by automotive manufacturers and electronic control unit (ECU) suppliers for development, analysis, simulation, testing, diagnostics and start-up of ECU networks and individual ECUs. Its widespread use and large number of supported vehicle bus systems makes it especially well suited for ECU development in conventional vehicles, as well as hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles. The simulation and testing facilities in CANoe are performed with CAPL, a programming language. CANoe supports CAN, LIN, FlexRay, Ethernet and MOSTCANoe on the website of Vector Informatik GmbH, downloaded December 21st, 2021 bus systems as well as CAN-based protocols such as J1939,CANoe.J1939, downloaded November 3rd, 2011 CANopen,CANopen solutions, downloaded November 3rd, 2011 ARINC 825,Overview CAN-based avionics protocols on www.avionics-networking.com, downloaded September 30th, 2010 ISOBUSDevelopment, Simulation and test of ISOBUS systems, downloaded November 3rd, 2011 and many more. == Description == In 1996 the first CANoe license was sold by Vector. Since then, the software has become established worldwide as a tool for ECU development. In addition to its primary use in automotive in- vehicle electronic networking, CANoe is also used in industries such as heavy trucks, rail transportation, special purpose vehicles, avionics, medical technology and many more.

Throughout the further course of ECU development, these models serve as a base for analysis, testing and integration of the bus systems and ECUs. Data is displayed and evaluated in either raw or symbolic format. Back in 1992, Vector developed the DBC data format, which has become a de facto standard for exchanging CAN descriptions in the automotive field. Other relevant standards are supported for other bus systems, e.g. FIBEX for FlexRay, LDF for LIN, Fibex for SOME/IP, EDS/DCF/XDD for CANopen. While CANoe can simulate the whole communication in a vehicle, it also includes a Test Feature Set, for creating automated test sequences. These automated test sequences can be controlled fully automated by usual CI tools (such as Jenkins etc). The Test Feature Set included in CANoe has a long history and is therefore available in variants; creation of test cases can be created in CAPL (Communication Access Programming Language - a C-like programming language), in XML, or in C#. The tests can either be manually programmed or generated automatically by different generators. CANoe's Ethernet option includes Ethernet Conformance Tests (TC8 test suite). CANoe's LIN option includes LIN Conformance slave tests. == Versions == Version 1.0 was released in 1996.Company History Vector , downloaded September 30th, 2010 The latest version of CANoe is 16. Program Levels Different variants of CANoe are available. They differ in functional scope (full, run, pex), supported bus systems (CAN, FlexRay, etc.) and supported higher protocols (SAE J1939, CANopen, etc.). The product supports the languages German, English and Japanese. == See also == * CANalyzer * CANape == References == ==Sources== * Pfeiffer, Ayre, Keydel: Embedded Networking with CAN and CANopen, RTC Books San Clemente, USA, 2003 * Pfeiffer, Ayre, Keydel: Embedded Networking with CAN and CANopen, RTC Books, Japan, 2006 (jap) * Toshikatsu Suzuki (Senko Medical), Hiroyoshi Takahashi (VJ): Developing a CANopen system for heart-lung machines, CAN Newsletter, Nuremberg Germany, September 2009 * Patrick E.
