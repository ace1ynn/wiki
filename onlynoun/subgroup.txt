In group theory, a branch of mathematics, given a group G under a binary operation ∗, a subset H of G is called a subgroup of G if H also forms a group under the operation ∗. More precisely, H is a subgroup of G if the restriction of ∗ to is a group operation on H. This is often denoted , read as "H is a subgroup of G". The trivial subgroup of any group is the subgroup {e} consisting of just the identity element. A proper subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H which is a proper subset of G (that is, ). This is often represented notationally by , read as "H is a proper subgroup of G". Some authors also exclude the trivial group from being proper (that is, }). If H is a subgroup of G, then G is sometimes called an overgroup of H. The same definitions apply more generally when G is an arbitrary semigroup, but this article will only deal with subgroups of groups. ==Subgroup tests== Suppose that G is a group, and H is a subset of G. For now, assume that the group operation of G is written multiplicatively, denoted by juxtaposition. *Then H is a subgroup of G if and only if H is nonempty and closed under products and inverses. Closed under products means that for every a and b in H, the product ab is in H. Closed under inverses means that for every a in H, the inverse a−1 is in H. These two conditions can be combined into one, that for every a and b in H, the element ab−1 is in H, but it is more natural and usually just as easy to test the two closure conditions separately. *When H is finite, the test can be simplified: H is a subgroup if and only if it is nonempty and closed under products. These conditions alone imply that every element a of H generates a finite cyclic subgroup of H, say of order n, and then the inverse of a is an−1. If the group operation is instead denoted by addition, then closed under products should be replaced by closed under addition, which is the condition that for every a and b in H, the sum a+b is in H, and closed under inverses should be edited to say that for every a in H, the inverse −a is in H. ==Basic properties of subgroups== *The identity of a subgroup is the identity of the group: if G is a group with identity eG, and H is a subgroup of G with identity eH, then eH = eG. *The inverse of an element in a subgroup is the inverse of the element in the group: if H is a subgroup of a group G, and a and b are elements of H such that ab = ba = eH, then ab = ba = eG. *If H is a subgroup of G, then the inclusion map H → G sending each element a of H to itself is a homomorphism. *The intersection of subgroups A and B of G is again a subgroup of G. For example, the intersection of the x-axis and y-axis in R under addition is the trivial subgroup. More generally, the intersection of an arbitrary collection of subgroups of G is a subgroup of G. *The union of subgroups A and B is a subgroup if and only if A ⊆ B or B ⊆ A. A non-example: 2Z ∪ 3Z is not a subgroup of Z, because 2 and 3 are elements of this subset whose sum, 5, is not in the subset. Similarly, the union of the x-axis and the y-axis in R is not a subgroup of R. *If S is a subset of G, then there exists a smallest subgroup containing S, namely the intersection of all of subgroups containing S; it is denoted by and is called the subgroup generated by S. An element of G is in if and only if it is a finite product of elements of S and their inverses, possibly repeated. *Every element a of a group G generates a cyclic subgroup . If is isomorphic to Z/nZ (the integers mod n) for some positive integer n, then n is the smallest positive integer for which an = e, and n is called the order of a. If is isomorphic to Z, then a is said to have infinite order. *The subgroups of any given group form a complete lattice under inclusion, called the lattice of subgroups. (While the infimum here is the usual set-theoretic intersection, the supremum of a set of subgroups is the subgroup generated by the set-theoretic union of the subgroups, not the set-theoretic union itself.) If e is the identity of G, then the trivial group {e} is the minimum subgroup of G, while the maximum subgroup is the group G itself. ==Cosets and Lagrange's theorem== Given a subgroup H and some a in G, we define the left coset aH = {ah : h in H}. Because a is invertible, the map φ : H → aH given by φ(h) = ah is a bijection. Furthermore, every element of G is contained in precisely one left coset of H; the left cosets are the equivalence classes corresponding to the equivalence relation a1 ~ a2 if and only if a1−1a2 is in H. The number of left cosets of H is called the index of H in G and is denoted by . Lagrange's theorem states that for a finite group G and a subgroup H, : [ G : H ] = { |G| \over |H| } where |G| and |H| denote the orders of G and H, respectively. In particular, the order of every subgroup of G (and the order of every element of G) must be a divisor of |G|.See a didactic proof in this video. Right cosets are defined analogously: Ha = {ha : h in H}. They are also the equivalence classes for a suitable equivalence relation and their number is equal to . If aH = Ha for every a in G, then H is said to be a normal subgroup. Every subgroup of index 2 is normal: the left cosets, and also the right cosets, are simply the subgroup and its complement. More generally, if p is the lowest prime dividing the order of a finite group G, then any subgroup of index p (if such exists) is normal. ==Example: Subgroups of Z8== Let G be the cyclic group Z8 whose elements are :G = \left\\{0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7\right\\} and whose group operation is addition modulo 8. Its Cayley table is \+ 0 4 2 6 1 5 3 7 0 0 4 2 6 1 5 3 7 4 4 0 6 2 5 1 7 3 2 2 6 4 0 3 7 5 1 6 6 2 0 4 7 3 1 5 1 1 5 3 7 2 6 4 0 5 5 1 7 3 6 2 0 4 3 3 7 5 1 4 0 6 2 7 7 3 1 5 0 4 2 6 This group has two nontrivial subgroups: and , where J is also a subgroup of H. The Cayley table for H is the top-left quadrant of the Cayley table for G; The Cayley table for J is the top-left quadrant of the Cayley table for H. The group G is cyclic, and so are its subgroups. In general, subgroups of cyclic groups are also cyclic. ==Example: Subgroups of S4== Let S4 be the symmetric group on 4 elements. Below are all the subgroups of S4, listed according to the number of elements, in decreasing order. ===24 elements=== The whole group S4 is a subgroup of S4, of order 24. Its Cayley table is ===12 elements=== ===8 elements=== ===6 elements=== ===4 elements=== ===3 elements=== ===2 elements=== Each element of order 2 in S4 generates a subgroup } of order 2. There are 9 such elements: the \binom{4}{2} = 6 transpositions (2-cycles) and the three elements (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23). ===1 element=== The trivial subgroup is the unique subgroup of order 1 in S4. ==Other examples== *The even integers form a subgroup 2Z of the integer ring Z: the sum of two even integers is even, and the negative of an even integer is even. *An ideal in a ring R is a subgroup of the additive group of R. *A linear subspace of a vector space is a subgroup of the additive group of vectors. *In an abelian group, the elements of finite order form a subgroup called the torsion subgroup. == See also == * Cartan subgroup * Fitting subgroup * Fixed-point subgroup * Fully normalized subgroup * Stable subgroup == Notes == == References == * . * . * . * * * * Category:Group theory Category:Subgroup properties .
