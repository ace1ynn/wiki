ConTeXt is a general-purpose document processor. Like LaTeX, it is derived from TeX. It is especially suited for structured documents, automated document production, very fine typography, and multi-lingual typesetting. It is based in part on the TeX typesetting system, and uses a document markup language for manuscript preparation. The typographical and automated capabilities of ConTeXt are extensive, including interfaces for handling microtypography, multiple footnotes and footnote classes, and manipulating OpenType fonts and features. Moreover, it offers extensive support for colors, backgrounds, hyperlinks, presentations, figure-text integration, and conditional compilation. It gives the user extensive control over formatting while making it easy to create new layouts and styles without learning the low-level TeX macro language. ConTeXt may be compared and contrasted with LaTeX, but the primary thrust of the two are rather distinct. ConTeXt from the ground up is a typography and typesetting system meant to provide users easy and consistent access to advanced typographical control—important for general-purpose typesetting tasks. The original vision of LaTeX is to insulate the user from typographical decisions—a useful approach for submitting e.g. articles for a scientific journal. LaTeX has evolved from that original vision; at the same time, ConTeXt's unified design avoids the package clashes that can happen with LaTeX."What is ConTeXt" page at contextgarden ConTeXt provides a multi-lingual user interface with support for markup in English, Dutch, German, French, and Italian and support for output in many languages including western European, eastern European, Arabic-script, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. It also allows the user to use different TeX engines like pdfTeX, XeTeX, and LuaTeX without changing the user interface. As its native drawing engine, ConTeXt integrates a superset of MetaPost called MetaFun, which allows the users to use the drawing abilities of MetaPost for page backgrounds and ornaments. Metafun can also be used with stand alone MetaPost. ConTeXt also supports the use of other external drawing engines, like PGF/TikZPGF/TikZ official manual. Version 2.0 .

April 2009. == Versions == The current version of ConTeXt is LMTX, introduced in April 2019 as the successor to Mark IV (MkIV). Previous versions — Mark II (MkII) and Mark I — are no longer maintained. According to the developers, the principal difference between LMTX and its predecessors is that the newest version "uses a compilation and scripting engine that is specifically developed with ConTeXt in mind: LuaMetaTeX ... [which] has been optimised heavily for ConTeXt use." Previously, MkIV used LuaTeX and MkII used pdfTeX. == History == ConTeXt was created by Hans HagenDave Walden interview Hans Hagen.

ConTeXt User Meeting 2007 (march 24)Programme of the ConTeXt User Meeting 2007 due to the need for educational typesetting material. Around 1996, Hans Hagen coined the name ConTeXt meaning "text with tex" (con-tex-t; "con" is a Latin preposition meaning "together with"). Before 1996 ConTeXt was used only within Pragma ADE, but in 1996 it began to be adopted by a wider audience. The first users outside Pragma were Taco Hoekwater, Berend de Boer and Gilbert van den Dobbelsteen, and the first user outside the Netherlands was Tobias Burnus. In July 2004, contextgarden.net wiki page was created.contextgarden 5th birthday on 24 July 2009 ConTeXt low-level code was originally written in Dutch. Around 2005, the ConTeXt developers began translating this to English, resulting in the version known as MKII, which is now stable and frozen.

ConTeXt documents come with the file extension .tex or an extension demarking the version required: `.mkii`, `.mkiv`, or `.mkxl` for regular TeX, `.mkvi` or `.mklx` for a dialect that supports named macro parameters in addition to TeX’s numeric ones. % This line is a comment because % precedes it. % It specifies the format of head named 'title' % Specifically the style of the font: sans serif % + bold + big font. \setuphead[title][style={\ss\bfd}, before={\begingroup}, after={John Doe, the author\smallskip% \currentdate\bigskip\endgroup}] \starttext \title{\CONTEXT} \section{Text} \CONTEXT\ is a document preparation system for the \TEX\ typesetting program.
