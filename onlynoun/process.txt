A process is a series or set of activities that interact to produce a result; it may occur once-only or be recurrent or periodic. Things called a process include: ==Business and management== *Business process, activities that produce a specific service or product for customers *Business process modeling, activity of representing processes of an enterprise in order to deliver improvements *Manufacturing process management, a collection of technologies and methods used to define how products are to be manufactured. *Process architecture, structural design of processes, applies to fields such as computers, business processes, logistics, project management *Process area, related processes within an area which together satisfies an important goal for improvements within that area *Process costing, a cost allocation procedure of managerial accounting *Process management (project management), a systematic series of activities directed towards planning, monitoring the performance and causing an end result in engineering activities, business process, manufacturing processes or project management *Process-based management, is a management approach that views a business as a collection of processes *Process industry, a category of material-related industry ==Law== *Due process, the concept that governments must respect the rule of law *Legal process, the proceedings and records of a legal case *Service of process, the procedure of giving official notice of a legal proceeding ==Science and technology== *The general concept of the scientific process, see scientific method *Process theory, the scientific study of processes *Industrial processes, consists of the purposeful sequencing of tasks that combine resources to produce a desired output ===Biology and psychology=== *Process (anatomy), a projection or outgrowth of tissue from a larger body *Biological process, a process of a living organism *Cognitive process, such as attention, memory, language use, reasoning, and problem solving *Mental process, a function or processes of the mind *Neuronal process, also neurite, a projection from the cell body of a neuron ===Chemistry=== *Chemical process, a method or means of changing one or more chemicals or chemical compounds *Unit process, a step in manufacturing in which chemical reaction takes place ===Computing=== *Process (computing), a computer program, or running a program concurrently with other programs **Child process, created by another process **Parent process *Process management (computing), an integral part of any modern-day operating system (OS) *Processing (programming language), an open- source language and integrated development environment ===Mathematics=== *In probability theory: **Branching process, a Markov process that models a population **Diffusion process, a solution to a stochastic differential equation **Empirical process, a stochastic process that describes the proportion of objects in a system in a given state **LÃ©vy process, a stochastic process with independent, stationary increments **Poisson process, a point process consisting of randomly located points on some underlying space **Predictable process, a stochastic process whose value is knowable **Stochastic process, a random process, as opposed to a deterministic process **Wiener process, a continuous-time stochastic process *Process calculus, a diverse family of related approaches for formally modeling concurrent systems *Process function, a mathematical concept used in thermodynamics ===Thermodynamics=== *Process function, a mathematical concept used in thermodynamics *Thermodynamic process, the energetic evolution of a thermodynamic system **Adiabatic process, which proceeds without transfer of heat or matter between a system and its surroundings **Isenthalpic process, in which enthalpy stays constant **Isobaric process, in which the pressure stays constant **Isochoric process, in which volume stays constant **Isothermal process, in which temperature stays constant **Polytropic process, which obeys the equation p v^{\,n} = C **Quasistatic process, which occurs infinitely slowly, as an approximation ==Other uses== *The Process, a concept in the film 3% *Food processing, transformation of raw ingredients, by physical or chemical means into food *Language processing in the brain *Natural language processing *Praxis (process), in philosophy, the process by which a theory or skill is enacted or realized *Process (engineering), set of interrelated tasks that transform inputs into outputs *Process philosophy, which regards change as the cornerstone of reality *Process thinking, a philosophy that focuses on present circumstances *Writing process, a concept in writing and composition studies ==External links== * * * Category:Business process Category:Business process management Category:Process engineering Category:Industrial processes Category:Technology-related lists Category:Legal procedure Category:Biological processes Category:Chemical processes Category:Process (computing) .
