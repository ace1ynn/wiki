thumb|Meadow orchard (Streuobstwiese) with view to the Lochenhörnle An orchard is an intentional plantation of trees or shrubs that is maintained for food production. Orchards comprise fruit- or nut-producing trees which are generally grown for commercial production. Orchards are also sometimes a feature of large gardens, where they serve an aesthetic as well as a productive purpose. A fruit garden is generally synonymous with an orchard, although it is set on a smaller non-commercial scale and may emphasize berry shrubs in preference to fruit trees. Most temperate-zone orchards are laid out in a regular grid, with a grazed or mown grass or bare soil base that makes maintenance and fruit gathering easy. Most modern commercial orchards are planted for a single variety of fruit. While the importance of introducing biodiversity is recognized in forest plantations, it would seem to be beneficial to introduce some genetic diversity in orchard plantations as well by interspersing other trees through the orchard. Genetic diversity in an orchard would provide resilience to pests and diseases just as in forests. Orchards are sometimes concentrated near bodies of water where climatic extremes are moderated and blossom time is retarded until frost danger is past. ==Layout== An orchard's layout is the technique of planting the crops in a proper system. There are different methods of planting and thus different layouts. Some of these layout types are: * Square method * Rectangular method * Quincunx method * Triangular method * Hexagonal method * Contour or terrace method For different varieties, these systems may vary to some extent. ==Orchards by region== left|thumb|A peach orchard in bloom [ca. 1950] The most extensive orchards in the United States are apple and orange orchards, although citrus orchards are more commonly called groves. The most extensive apple orchard area is in eastern Washington state, with a lesser but significant apple orchard area in most of Upstate New York. Extensive orange orchards are found in Florida and southern California, where they are more widely known as "groves". In eastern North America, many orchards are along the shores of Lake Michigan (such as the Fruit Ridge Region), Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario. In Canada, apple and other fruit orchards are widespread on the Niagara Peninsula, south of Lake Ontario. This region is known as Canada Fruitbelt and, in addition to large-scale commercial fruit marketing, it encourages "pick-your-own" activities in the harvest season. Murcia is a major orchard area (or la huerta) in Europe, with citrus crops. New Zealand, China, Argentina, and Chile also have extensive apple orchards. Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire has been called The Town in the Orchard, since the 19th century, because it was surrounded by extensive orchards. Today, this heritage is celebrated through an annual Applefest. ===Central Europe=== Streuobstwiese (pl. ) is a German word that means a meadow with scattered fruit trees or fruit trees that are planted in a field. , or a meadow orchard,Streuobstwiese: meadow orchard in German-English Collins Dictionary is a traditional landscape in the temperate, maritime climate of continental Western Europe. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, were a kind of a rural community orchard that were intended for the productive cultivation of stone fruit. In recent years, ecologists have successfully lobbied for state subsidies to valuable habitats, biodiversity and natural landscapes, which are also used to preserve old meadow orchards. Both conventional and meadow orchards provide a suitable habitat for many animal species that live in a cultured landscape. A notable example is the hoopoe that nests in tree hollows of old fruit trees and, in the absence of alternative nesting sites, is threatened in many parts of Europe because of the destruction of old orchards.Berhens M. Why hoopoes won't trade. A Pro Natura Publication on the Global Economy and Nature. Pro Natura, Switzerland, pp. 8-9.

Modern commercial apple orchards, by contrast and as one example, are often "high-density" (tree density above ), and in extreme cases have up to . These plants are no longer trees in the traditional sense, but instead resemble vines on dwarf stock and require trellises to support them.

The campaign #BlossomWatch is part of a wider programme of work by the Trust to plant 68 new orchards by 2025, and four million trees with blossom by 2030. ==See also== * Climate-friendly gardening * Forest * Forest gardening * Fruit tree forms * Fruit tree pollination * Fruit tree propagation * Fruit tree pruning ==References== ==External links== * Home Orchard Society * Pennsylvania tree fruit production guide; a guide on how to set up an orchard in practice * Category:Agricultural establishments Category:Horticulture Category:Trees Category:Fruit trees Category:Types of farms .
