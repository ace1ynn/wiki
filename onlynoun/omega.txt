Omega (; capital: Ω, lowercase: ω; Ancient Greek ὦ, later ὦ μέγα, Modern Greek ωμέγα) is the twenty-fourth and final letter in the Greek alphabet. In the Greek numeric system/isopsephy (gematria), it has a value of 800. The word literally means "great O" (ō mega, mega meaning "great"), as opposed to omicron, which means "little O" (o mikron, micron meaning "little"). In phonetic terms, the Ancient Greek Ω represented a long open-mid back rounded vowel , comparable to the "aw" of the English word raw in dialects without the cot–caught merger, in contrast to omicron which represented the close-mid back rounded vowel , and the digraph ου which represented the long close-mid back rounded vowel . In Modern Greek, both omega and omicron represent the mid back rounded vowel or . The letter omega is transliterated into a Latin-script alphabet as ō or simply o. As the final letter in the Greek alphabet, omega is often used to denote the last, the end, or the ultimate limit of a set, in contrast to alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet; see Alpha and Omega. ==History== Ω was not part of the early (8th century BC) Greek alphabets. It was introduced in the late 7th century BC in the Ionian cities of Asia Minor to denote a long open-mid back rounded vowel . It is a variant of omicron (Ο), broken up at the side (x16px), with the edges subsequently turned outward (, , , ).Anne Jeffery (1961), The local scripts of archaic Greece, p.37–38. The Dorian city of Knidos as well as a few Aegean islands, namely Paros, Thasos and Melos, chose the exact opposite innovation, using a broken-up circle for the short and a closed circle for the long . The name Ωμέγα is Byzantine; in Classical Greek, the letter was called ō () (pronounced /ɔ̂ː/), whereas the omicron was called ou () (pronounced /ôː/).Herbert Weir Smyth. A Greek Grammar for Colleges. §1 The modern lowercase shape goes back to the uncial form x14px, a form that developed during the 3rd century BC in ancient handwriting on papyrus, from a flattened-out form of the letter (x16px) that had its edges curved even further upward.Edward M. Thompson (1912), Introduction to Greek and Latin paleography, Oxford: Clarendon. p.144 In addition to the Greek alphabet, Omega was also adopted into the early Cyrillic alphabet. See Cyrillic omega (Ѡ, ѡ). A Raetic variant is conjectured to be at the origin or parallel evolution of the Elder Futhark ᛟ. Omega was also adopted into the Latin alphabet, as a letter of the 1982 revision to the African reference alphabet. It has had little use. See Latin omega. == The symbol Ω (uppercase letter) == The uppercase letter Ω is used as a symbol: * In chemistry: ** For oxygen-18, a natural, stable isotope of oxygen. ** For omega loop, a protein structural motif consisting of a loop of six or more amino acid residues in any sequence, a structure named for its resemblance to the Greek letter. * In physics: ** For ohm – SI unit of electrical resistance; formerly also used upside down (℧) to represent mho, the old name for the inverse of an ohm (now siemens with symbol S) used for electrical conductance. Unicode has a separate code point for the ohm sign (U+2126, Ω), but it is included only for backward compatibility, and the Greek uppercase omega character (U+03A9, Ω) is preferred.Excerpts from The Unicode Standard, Version 4.0.
