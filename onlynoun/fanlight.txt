A fanlight is a form of lunette window, often semicircular or semi-elliptical in shape, with glazing bars or tracery sets radiating out like an open fan. It is placed over another window or a doorway, and is sometimes hinged to a transom. The bars in the fixed glazed window spread out in the manner of a sunburst. It is also called a "sunburst light". == Gallery == Image:Priestley Door.jpg|Main door and fanlight, Joseph Priestley House in Northumberland, Pennsylvania Image:2007-04-08DeilingenKapelle05.jpg| Image:03576 - Porta Venezia, Milano - Dettaglio - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 23-Jun-2007.jpg|City gate Milan, Italy Image:Palácio-da-Pena Pátio-dos-Arcos 1 (OUT-07).jpg|Palácio Nacional da Pena, Sintra, Portugal Image:AriahParkHotelLeadlight.jpg|Hotel, Ariah Park, New South Wales File:Lunette over door.jpg|Fanlight over door with side lights == See also == * Lunette == References == == External links == * Doorways around the World Category:Glass architecture Category:Windows .
