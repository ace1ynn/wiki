MotorCycle is the tenth studio album by Christian alternative rock band Daniel Amos, issued in 1993 on BAI Records. It was the band's first album under the Daniel Amos moniker - as opposed to the shortened DA - since Vox Humana in 1984. The album saw the band temporarily shift their sound to neo-psychedelia and saw the return of longtime guitarist Jerry Chamberlain. The album was dedicated to the memory of singer-songwriter Mark Heard, who died in 1992. Writing for AllMusic, J. Edward Keyes described the album as "meticulously crafted, haunting, and beautiful beyond words ... a psych-pop tour de force." "Grace is the Smell of Rain" was later rerecorded by lead singer Terry Scott Taylor's other band, the Lost Dogs, for their 2004 album MUTT. == Track listing == # "Banquet at the World's End" (words and music by Taylor) (3:47) # "Traps, Ensnares" (words and music by Taylor/Chamberlain) (3:49) # "Hole in the World" (words and music by Taylor) (5:32) # "(What's Come) Over Me" (words and music by Taylor) (3:48) # "Buffalo Hills" (words and music by Taylor) (4:24) # "Guilty" (words and music by Taylor) (4:35) # "Motorcycle" (words by Taylor, music by Taylor/Flesch/Chandler) (3:33) # "Wonderful" (words by Taylor/Chamberlain/McCall, music by Taylor/Chamberlain) (2:16) # "So Long" (words and music by Taylor) (0:56) # "My Frontier" (words and music by Taylor) (3:48) # "Grace is the Smell of Rain" (words by Taylor, music by Taylor/Chamberlain) (4:01) # "Noelle" (words and music by Taylor) (2:43) # "Wise Acres" (words and music by Taylor) (2:14) # "So Long Again" (words by Taylor, music by Taylor/Chamberlain) (2:53) == Personnel == * Jerry Chamberlain — lead and rhythm guitars, lap-steel guitar, electric sitar, backing vocals, lead vocal on "Wonderful", cover concept * Tim Chandler — bass guitar and backing vocals * Greg Flesch — lead and rhythm guitars, pan flute, and squeeze box * Ed McTaggart — drums, percussion, backing vocals, art direction * Terry Scott Taylor — guitars, harmonica, lead vocals, backing vocals, cover concept * Gene Eugene — piano, audio engineer * Steve Hindalong — additional percussion * Buckeye Dan Michaels — trumpet * Rob Watson — piano, organ, and synthesizer * Sharon McCall — backing vocals * Bob Moon — additional engineer * Dave Hackbarth — additional engineer * Chris Colbert — additional engineer * The Golden Recording Room, Huntington Beach, California — recording location, mixing location * Neverland Studios, Cerritos, California — recording location * McCrums, Whittier, California — recording location * Doug Doyle — mastering * Digital Brothers — mastering location * Bruce Heavin — cover concept, illustration * Daniel Amos — musical arrangements * Wax Lips Studios — pre-production demo recording location == References == Category:1993 albums Category:Daniel Amos albums .
