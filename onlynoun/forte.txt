It was developed and launched by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in cooperation with Sandia National Laboratory, as a testbed for technologies applicable to U.S. nuclear detonation detection systems used to monitor compliance with arms control treaties, and later to study lightning from space.The Newsbulletin, March 20, 2002 | Los Alamos National Laboratory The project was sponsored by the United States Department of Energy, and cost about US$35 million. It utilizes optical sensors, RF sensors, and an "event classifier" in order to make observations, including monitoring Very High Frequency (VHF) lightning emissions in the ionosphere occurring from between above the surface of the Earth, and it will be a component of the VHF Global Lightning and Severe Storm Monitor (V-GLASS) system. Its primary mission is to record and analyze bursts of RF energy rising from the surface of the Earth. FORTE is tall, weighs , and is the first all-composite spacecraft, its framework being made entirely of graphite- reinforced epoxy. It consists of three decks with aluminum honeycomb cores, and composite facing to support the onboard instruments. == References == == External links == * Los Alamos National Laboratory: FORTE (Fast On-orbit Recording of Transient Events) Category:Reconnaissance satellites of the United States Category:United States Department of Energy Category:Satellites of the United States Air Force Category:Spacecraft launched in 1997 Category:Spacecraft launched by Pegasus rockets .
