The meat is typically chicken or turkey breast, in conformance with dietary kashrut laws, which prohibit pork.

Before frying, the schnitzel is coated with a mixture of beaten eggs and bread crumbs, sometimes spiced with paprika or sesame seeds. It is usually served with mashed potatoes, French fries, rice, or pasta, accompanied by ketchup, hummus, or vegetable salad. The schnitzel tradition was brought from Europe to Israel by Ashkenazi Jews.

Packaged schnitzels are widely available in the frozen food section of most supermarkets.
