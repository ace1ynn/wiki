A hound is a type of hunting dog used by hunters to track or chase prey. ==Description== Hounds can be contrasted with gun dogs that assist hunters by identifying prey and/or recovering shot quarry. The hound breeds were the first hunting dogs. They have either a powerful sense of smell, great speed, or both. There are three types of hound, with several breeds type: * Sighthounds (also called gazehounds) follow prey predominantly by speed, keeping it in sight. These dogs are fast and assist hunters in catching game: fox, hare, deer, and elk. * Scenthounds follow prey or others (like missing people) by tracking its scent. These dogs have endurance, but are not fast runners. * The remaining breeds of hound follow their prey using both sight and scent. They are difficult to classify, as they are neither strictly sighthounds nor strictly scenthounds. ==List of hound breeds== * Afghan Hound * Africanis * Alpine Dachsbracke * American Foxhound * American Leopard Hound * Andalusian Hound * Artois Hound * Austrian Black and Tan Hound * Azawakh * Basenji * Basset Artesien Normand * Basset Bleu de Gascogne * Basset Fauve de Bretagne * Basset Hound * Bavarian Mountain Hound * Beagle * Beagle-Harrier * Billy * Black and Tan Coonhound * Blackmouth Cur * Bloodhound * Bluetick Coonhound * Borzoi * Bosnian Broken-haired Hound * Briquet Griffon Vendéen * Chippiparai * Cirneco dell'Etna * Combai * Coonhound * Cretan Hound * Dachshund * Drever * Dumfriesshire Black and Tan Foxhound * Estonian Hound * English Coonhound * English Foxhound * Feist * Finnish Hound * Galgo Español * Gascon Saintongeois * German Hound * Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen * Grand Bleu de Gascogne * Grand Fauve de Bretagne * Grand Griffon Vendéen * Greek Harehound * Greyhound * Griffon Bleu de Gascogne * Griffon Fauve de Bretagne * Hamiltonstövare * Hanover Hound * Harrier * Hortaya borzaya * Ibizan Hound * Indian pariah dog * Italian Greyhound * Irish Wolfhound * Istrian Coarse- haired Hound * Istrian Shorthaired Hound * Kai Ken * Kanni * Kishu Ken * Lakeland Trailhound * Lithuanian Hound * Longdog * Lurcher * Magyar agár * Mountain Cur * Mudhol Hound * Otterhound * Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen * Petit Bleu de Gascogne * Pharaoh Hound * Plott Hound * Podenco Canario * Polish Greyhound * Polish Hound * Portuguese Podengo * Posavac Hound * Rajapalayam * Rampur Greyhound * Rastreador Brasileiro * Redbone Coonhound * Rhodesian Ridgeback * Sabueso Español * Saluki * Schillerstövare * Segugio dell'Appennino * Segugio Italiano a pelo forte * Segugio Italiano a pelo raso * Segugio Maremmano * Serbian Hound * Serbian Tricolour Hound * Schweizer Laufhund * Schweizerischer Niederlaufhund * Scottish Deerhound * Shikoku * Silken Windhound * Sloughi * Smalandstövare * Styrian Coarse-haired Hound * Taigan * Treeing Walker Coonhound * Trigg Hound * Transylvanian Hound * Tyrolean Hound * Welsh Foxhound * Westphalian Dachsbracke * Whippet == See also == * Dog type * Hunting dog * Scent hound * Sighthound ==References== == External links == * * Category:Dog types Category:Hunting dogs Category:Hunting with hounds Category:Dog shows and showing .
