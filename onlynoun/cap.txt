A cap is a flat headgear, usually with a visor. Caps have crowns that fit very close to the head. They made their first appearance as early as 3200 BC. Caps typically have a visor, or no brim at all. They are popular in casual and informal settings, and are seen in sports and fashion. They are typically designed for warmth, and often incorporate a visor to block sunlight from the eyes. They come in many shapes, sizes, and are of different brands. Baseball caps are one of the most common types of cap. == Types== * Ascot cap * Ayam * Baggy green * Balmoral * Beanie (North America) * Bearskin * Beret * Biretta * Busby * Canterbury cap * Cap and bells * Cap of maintenance * Casquette * Caubeen * Caul * Coif * Combination cap (also known as a service cap) * Coppola * Cricket cap * Deerstalker * Do-rag * Dutch cap * Dixie cup, an enlisted sailor's cap, also worn by first-year midshipmen at Annapolis * Fez * Flat cap (also known as a Kerry cap in Ireland (slang of Paddy cap – see also Caubeen), longshoreman's cap, scally cap, Wigens cap, ivy cap, golf cap, duffer cap, driving cap, bicycle cap, Jeff cap, or in Scotland, bunnet, or in Wales, Dai cap, or in England or New Zealand, cheese-cutter) * Forage cap * Gandhi cap * Garrison cap * Glengarry * Greek fisherman's cap (also known as a Breton cap or a fiddler's cap) * Juliet cap * Karakul * Kepi * Kippah (also known as yarmulke or skull cap) — worn by Jewish males * Knit cap (also known as a Tuque, stocking cap, wool cap, watch cap, ski cap, bobble hat) * Kufi (also known as a kofia; an African cap worn with a dashiki) * Lika cap * M43 field cap * Mao cap * Meyrick Helmet * Monmouth cap * Newsboy cap * Nightcap * Nurse cap * Ochipok * Papakhi * Patrol cap * Peaked cap * Phrygian cap * Rastacap * Sailor cap * Shako * Shower cap * Sindhi cap * Sports visor * Square academic cap * Stormy Kromer cap * Swim cap * Tam o' Shanter * Taqiyah, worn by Muslim males * Toque * Tubeteika * Ushanka * Utility cover * Zucchetto ===Baseball caps=== * Baseball cap * Fitted cap * Snapback * Trucker hat == Present day depictions of caps == Caps might have started off as a way to keep people shaded from the sun, but now they are much more than that. Caps have made a staple in the both the sports and fashion industries, one leading into the other. === Sports === Like previously stated caps are typically designed with a visor which makes it perfect for keeping a person cool from the heat and sheltering a person's eyes from the sun, so it was a matter of time before they made it to the sports industry. The first sport to adopt wearing caps was baseball, the hats was made out of straw and were worn on April 24, 1849, by the New York Knickerbockers. However, within a few years time the team began to wear a cap made of fine merino wool, that featured a crown and an attached visor. This design became the prototype for caps of that time and still the most popular in present day. It's also not the only design for baseball hats but other sports as well, such as cricket, golf and tennis. === Fashion === Sportswear found its way to fashion in the nineteenth century and on the contrary to what many believe it began to actually cater to the wants and needs of women. Sports cap however made an impact on the fashion industry around the 1980s when the company New Era, who had been designing hats for sports teams, began designing and selling hats to the general public. Baseball caps, fitted caps, snapback caps and truckers hats would then be seen in music videos, films, runways and even on Princess Diana's head, which helped nurture her appearance as the "people's princess." Along with hats, sports jerseys also became available in the 1980s as well, and now licensed apparel is a multi-billion dollar industry. == See also == * Bonnet, until about 1700, the usual word for brimless male headgear * Cap (sport), metaphorical term * List of headgear ==References== Category:Headgear .
