A scarecrow is a decoy or mannequin that is often in the shape of a human. Humanoid scarecrows are usually dressed in old clothes and placed in open fields to discourage birds from disturbing and feeding on recently cast seed and growing crops.Lesley Brown (ed.). (2007). "Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles". 6th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. . Scarecrows are used around the world by farmers, and are a notable symbol of farms and the countryside in popular culture. ==Design== The common form of a scarecrow is a humanoid figure dressed in old clothes and placed in open fields to discourage birds such as crows or sparrows from disturbing and feeding on recently cast seed and growing crops. Machinery such as windmills have been employed as scarecrows, but the effectiveness lessens as animals become familiar with the structures. Since the invention of the humanoid scarecrow, more effective methods have been developed. On California farmland, highly-reflective aluminized PET film ribbons are tied to the plants to produce shimmers from the sun. Another approach is using automatic noise guns powered by propane gas. One winery in New York has even used inflatable tube men or airdancers to scare away birds. ==Cultural impact== thumb|Circle of scarecrow children at Joe's Scarecrow Village * Joe's Scarecrow Village in Cape Breton, Canada, is a roadside attraction displaying dozens of scarecrows. * The Japanese village of Nagoro, on the island of Shikoku in the Tokushima Prefecture, has 35 inhabitants but more than 350 scarecrows. * In the United Kingdom, where the use of scarecrows as a protector of crops dates from time immemorial and where there are a few different languages and several different dialects, there are a wide range of alternative names such as: Name Locale Hodmedod Berkshire Murmet Devon Hay-man England Gallybagger Isle of Wight Tattie Bogal Isle of Skye Tattie bogleWarrack, Alexander (1982).
