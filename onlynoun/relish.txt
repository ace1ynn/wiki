A relish is a cooked and pickled product made of chopped vegetables, fruits or herbs and is a food item typically used as a condiment to enhance a staple. Examples are chutneys and the North American relish, a pickled cucumber jam eaten with hot dogs. In North America, the word "relish" is frequently used to describe a single variety of finely-chopped pickled cucumber relish, such as pickle, dill and sweet relishes. Relish generally consists of discernible vegetable or fruit pieces in a sauce, although the sauce is subordinate in character to the vegetable or fruit pieces. Herbs may also be used, and some relishes, such as chermoula, are prepared entirely using herbs and spices. Relish can consist of a single type or a combination of vegetables and fruit, which may be coarsely or finely chopped; its texture will vary depending on the slicing style used for these solid ingredients, but generally a relish is not as smooth as a sauce-type condiment such as ketchup. Relish typically has a strong flavor that complements or adds to the primary food item with which it is served. == Varieties == This is a list of notable relishes. * Ajika * Ajvar * Achar * Atchara * Bostongurka * Biber salçası * Branston relish * Chakalaka * Chermoula * Chow-chow * Chrain * Chutney * Cranberry relish * Ćwikła – Polish beet relish * Dill relish * Doenjang * Gentleman's Relish – was invented in 1828 by John Osborn and contains spiced anchovy.
