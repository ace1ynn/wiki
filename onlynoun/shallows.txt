Shallows (1984) is a novel by Australian author Tim Winton. It won the 1984 Miles Franklin Award, and was the 1985 joint winner of Western Australian Premier's Book Award - Fiction. Carolyn See called it "a dark masterpiece that ranks with Moby-Dick"."Young Men and the Sea", Carolyn See, The Washington Post, June 27, 2008; Page C05 ==Story outline== The novel is set in 1978 in the fictional town of Angelus, Western Australia. The town is the last remaining remnant of Australia's whaling industry and the novel details the conflicts that arise as a group of outsiders, intent on closing down the whaling industry, come to town. ==Critical reception== Marian Eldridge in The Canberra Times was impressed with the work: "It is a book resonant with meanings. On the surface it looks at a contemporary situation, a year-old relationship under strain as one partner becomes an active conservationist and the other an uncommitted, embarrassed observer. Whatever one decides the novel is saying, Shallows is a satisfying book.""'Shallows' complex, disturbing" by Marian Eldridge, The Canberra Times, 9 March 1985, p16 == Awards == 1984 Miles Franklin Award."Franklin award to Winton", The Canberra Times, 15 May 1985, p24 1985 Joint Winner Western Australian Premier's Book Award - Fiction. ==References== Category:1984 Australian novels Category:20th-century Australian novels Category:Books about whaling Category:Environmental fiction books Category:Miles Franklin Award-winning works Category:Novels by Tim Winton .
