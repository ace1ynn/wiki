CROCUS is a research reactor at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, a research institute and university in Lausanne, Switzerland. The uranium nuclear reactor core is in an aluminium container that measures across with -thick walls. The aluminum vessel is filled with demineralized light water to serve as both a neutron moderator and a neutron reflector. Power output is controlled either by adjusting the water level in the reactor—with a ± level of control, or with the adjustment of two boron carbide (BC) control rods—with a ± level of finesse. The reactor has six separate safety systems: two cadmium shields and four storage tanks, any of which can shut down the reaction in less than a second. CROCUS has a license to produce or a neutron flux of ~2.5 × 10 cms at the core's center. ==References== ==See also== * Category:École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne Category:nuclear research reactors .
