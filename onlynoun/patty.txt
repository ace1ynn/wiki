A patty or burger (in British English) is a flattened, usually round, serving of ground meat and/or legumes, grains, vegetables, or meat alternatives. Patties are found in multiple cuisines throughout the world. In British and American English, minced meat that is formed into a disc is called a burger, whether it is in a bread roll or not. The word "patty" is also used in American English but almost unknown in British English. The ingredients are compacted and shaped, usually cooked, and served in various ways. Some foods termed "patties" use ingredients inside a pastry crust that is then baked or fried. Some patties are breaded, then baked or fried. In London, since the late 1980s, the Jamaican patty, similar to the Cornish pastie, is a common food item. == Etymology == The term originated in the 17th century as an English alteration of the French word pâté. According to the OED, it is related to the word pasty, which is various ingredients encased in pastry. == Terminology == The term "patty" is used in many varieties of English, but less frequently in Britain and Ireland than in the United States.Google ngrams comparison of the phrase "hamburger patty/ies" in US and UK English. Merriam- Webster defines it as "a small flat cake of chopped food", Cambridge as "pieces of food, especially meat, formed into a thin, circular shape and then usually cooked". In some countries, patties may be called "discs." Similar- shaped cakes not made from ground beef may also be called "burgers": "fish burgers" may be made from reshaped mechanically separated meat. Patties made from chicken meat may be called chicken patties. Veggie burger patties are made without meat and instead use legumes, grains, other mixed vegetables, and/or soy products such as tofu or tempeh or seitan, a product made of wheat gluten, often mixed with a binding agent. == Variations and serving styles == === Croquettes === alt=ground meat patty|thumb|Korokke Patties can be breaded and deep-fried, producing croquettes such as crab cakes.

Caribbean Beef Patty Co., Business Is Cooking 14 February 2005; Page A03 Washington Post ==Commercial production== thumb|Two pre-formed hamburger patties Commercially produced patties are machine-formed. With mass-produced patties, it is not uncommon to find them with seemingly abnormal shapes or a bumpy perimeter. These groove-like bumps are caused by the machine that forms the patties. They are used in production to keep the patties in line, so they will not fall off the assembly line, and can be manipulated by the various machines. In other boxed patties, small punctures can be seen in the top and bottom sides of the patty. These punctures are there for similar reasons. ==See also== *Kofta, a related dish that is formed into patties or balls * List of hamburgers * Meatball, a similar dish but rounded rather than flattened ==References== Category:World cuisine Category:Ground meat .
