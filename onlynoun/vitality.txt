Vitality (, , ) is the capacity to live, grow, or develop. More simply it is the property of having life. The perception of vitality is regarded as a basic psychological drive and, in philosophy, a component to the will to live. As such, people seek to maximize their vitality or their experience of vitality—that which corresponds to an enhanced physiological capacity and mental state. == Overview == The pursuit and maintenance of health and vitality have been at the forefront of medicine and natural philosophy throughout history. Life depends upon various biological processes known as vital processes. As such, vitality is also the characteristic distinction of living from non-living things. Historically, these vital processes have been viewed as having either mechanistic or non-mechanistic causes. The latter of which is characteristic of vitalism, the doctrine that the phenomena of life cannot be explained by purely chemical and physical mechanisms. Prior to the 19th century, theoreticians often held that human lifespan had been less limited in the past, and that aging was due to a loss of, and failure to maintain, vitality. A commonly held view was that people are born with finite vitality, which diminishes over time until illness and debility set in, and finally death. == Religion == In traditional cultures, the capacity for life is often directly equated with the or . This can be found in the Hindu concept , where vitality in the body derives from a subtle principle in the air and in food, as well as in Hebrew and ancient Greek texts. === Jainism === ==Vitality and DNA damage== Low vitality or fatigue is a common complaint by older patients during their visits to a physician.Maynard S, Keijzers G, Hansen AM, Osler M, Molbo D, Bendix L, Møller P, Loft S, Moreno-Villanueva M, Bürkle A, Hvitby CP, Schurman SH, Stevnsner T, Rasmussen LJ, Avlund K, Bohr VA. Associations of subjective vitality with DNA damage, cardiovascular risk factors and physical performance. Acta Physiol (Oxf). 2015 Jan;213(1):156-70. doi: 10.1111/apha.12296. Epub 2014 Apr 23. PMID: 24703498; PMCID: PMC4586176 Low vitality is increasingly seen as an early indicator of frailty and may reflect an underlying medical illness. Vitality level was measured in 2,487 Copenhagen patients using a standardized, subjective, self-reported vitality scale and was found to be inversely related to DNA damage (as measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells). DNA damage is indicative of cellular disfunction. == See also == * Jīvitindriya * Urban vitality * Vitalism == References == Category:Jain philosophical concepts Category:Natural philosophy Category:Philosophy of life Category:Quality of life .
