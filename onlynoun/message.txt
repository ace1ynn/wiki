thumb|240px|Geheime Korrespondenz (secret correspondence), by Carl von Bergen A message is a discrete unit of communication intended by the source for consumption by some recipient or group of recipients. A message may be delivered by various means, including courier, telegraphy, carrier pigeon and electronic bus. A message can be the content of a broadcast. An interactive exchange of messages forms a conversation. One example of a message is a press release, which may vary from a brief report or statement released by a public agency to commercial publicity material. ==History== ==Roles in human communication == In communication between humans, messages can be verbal or nonverbal: * A verbal message is an exchange of information using words. Examples include face-to-face communication, telephone calls, voicemails, email etc. * A nonverbal message is communicated through actions or behaviors rather than words, such as conscious or unconscious body language. == In computer science == There are two main senses of the word "message" in computing: messages between the human users of computer systems that are delivered by those computer systems, and messages passed between programs or between components of a single program, for their own purposes. * Instant messaging and emails are examples of computer software designed for delivering human-readable messages in formatted or unformatted text, from one person to another. * Message passing is a form of communication used in concurrent and parallel computing, object-oriented programming, and channel communicate, where communication is made by sending messages to recipients. In a related use of this sense of a message, in object-oriented programming language such as main library ["msg" box]Smalltalk or Java, a message is sent to an object, specifying a request for action. === Safety and privacy concerns === Safety and privacy concerns have been expressed in the computer science industry regarding messages. There have been cases where instant messaging apps were found to present a risk of spyware infection. Text messaging is one of the larger causes of distracted driving, and the act of texting and driving has been made illegal in many states as a result. == See also == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==References== ==External links== * * * J Category:Communication .
