thumb|Memorial plaque presented by the National Capital Sesquicentennial Commission, 1951 An anniversary is the date on which an event took place or an institution was founded in a previous year, and may also refer to the commemoration or celebration of that event. The word was first used for Catholic feasts to commemorate saints. Most countries celebrate national anniversaries, typically called national days. These could be the date of independence of the nation or the adoption of a new constitution or form of government. There is no definite method for determining the date of establishment of an institution, and it is generally decided within the institution by convention. The important dates in a sitting monarch's reign may also be commemorated, an event often referred to as a "jubilee". ==Names== * Birthdays are the most common type of anniversary, on which someone's birthdate is commemorated each year. The actual celebration is sometimes moved for practical reasons, as in the case of an official birthday or one falling on February 29. * Wedding anniversaries are also often celebrated, on the same day of the year as the wedding occurred. * Death anniversaries. The Latin phrase dies natalis (literally "birth day") has become a common term, adopted in many languages, especially in intellectual and institutional circles, for the anniversary of the founding ("legal or statutory birth") of an institution, such as an alma mater (college or other school). In ancient Rome, the [dies] Aquilae natalis was the "birthday of the eagle", the anniversary of the official founding of a legion. Anniversaries of nations are usually marked by the number of years elapsed, expressed with Latin words or Roman numerals. ===Numerical=== Latin terms for anniversaries are mostly straightforward, particularly those relating to the first thirty years (1–30), or multiples of ten years (30, 40, 50, 60, 70 etc.), or multiples of centuries or millenniums (100, 200, 300, 1000, 2000, 3000, etc.) In these instances, the name of the anniversary is generally derived from the Latin word(s) for the respective number of years. When anniversaries relate to fractions of centuries (125, 150, 175, 225 years—i.e. 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, and 2.25 centuries), the situation is not as simple. Roman fractions were based on a duodecimal system. From to they were expressed as multiples of twelfths (uncia "twelfth"; the source of the English words inch and ounce) and from to they were expressed as multiple twelfths less than the next whole unit—i.e. a whole unit less , or respectively. There were also special terms for quarter (quadrans), half (semis), and three-quarters (dodrans). Dodrans is a Latin contraction of de- quadrans which means "a whole unit less a quarter" (de means "from"; quadrans means "quarter"). Thus for the example of 175 years, the term is a quarter century less than the next whole (bi)century or 175 = (−25 + 200). In Latin, it seems that this rule did not apply precisely for . While secundus is Latin for "second", and bis for "twice", these terms are not used such as in sesqui- secundus. Instead sesqui (or ses) is used by itself.

Chapman to William Safire; first appeared in Safire's column, "On Language" (The New York Times Magazine, February 12, 1995). It is a coined word for an anniversary of 175 years, but the elements of the word literally refer to an anniversary of 35,000 years, as follows: septaquinta- (70) × quinque- (5) × centennial (100 years) 180 years octodecacentennial 190 years nonadecacentennial 200 years bicentennial 200 years 225 years quasquibicentennial 250 years sestercentennial To express in Latin it would be expressed as "half-three". The term relates to being halfway [from the second] to the third integer. In Latin this is "sestertius", which is a contraction of semis (halfway) tertius (third)—hence sestercentennial. 250 years semiquincentennial Probably a modern coined term: semi- (half) × quin (5) × centennial (100 years) = 250 years. Used by Brown University in 2015. 250 years bicenquinquagenary Used by Princeton University in 1996, Reading, Pennsylvania in 1998, and Washington and Lee University in 1999. It is a coined word for an anniversary of 250 years: bi- (2) × cen(t)- (100) + quinquagenary (50 years). 250 years quarter-millennial 250 years quadransmillennial From quadrans- (quarter) x millennial (1000 years). 275 years dodranstricentennial 300 years tercentenary 300 years tercentennial 300 years tricentenary 300 years tricentennial 325 years quasquitricentennial 350 years sesquarcentennial sesquarcentennial is a modern coined term; sesquarcentennial for 350 years is deduced here from the "sestertius" definition for 250 years above. For 350 years it relates to being halfway from the third to the fourth integer; thus a contraction of semis (halfway) and quartus (fourth); hence sesquarcentennial. semiseptcennial is probably a modern coined term: semi- (half) × sept (7) × cen(t)- (100) × centennial (350 years). 350 years semiseptcentennial sesquarcentennial is a modern coined term; sesquarcentennial for 350 years is deduced here from the "sestertius" definition for 250 years above.

Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home by Emily Post, published in 1922, contained suggestions for wedding anniversary gifts for 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, and 75 years. Wedding anniversary gift suggestions for other years were added in later editions and publications; they now comprise what is referred to as the "traditional" list. Generally speaking, the longer the period, the more precious or durable the material associated with it. There are variations according to some national traditions. There exist numerous partially overlapping, partially contradictory lists of anniversary gifts (such as wedding stones), separate from the 'traditional' names. The concepts of a person's birthday stone and zodiac stone, by contrast, are fixed for life according to the day of the week, month, or astrological sign corresponding to the recipient's birthday. ==See also== * List of historical anniversaries * Quinquennial Neronia * Wedding anniversary * Death anniversary ==References== == External links== .
