A gazelle is one of many antelope species in the genus Gazella . This article also deals with the seven species included in two further genera, Eudorcas and Nanger, which were formerly considered subgenera of Gazella. A third former subgenus, Procapra, includes three living species of Asian gazelles. Gazelles are known as swift animals. Some are able to run at bursts as high as or run at a sustained speed of ."Gazelle". The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. 2007, Columbia University Press. Gazelles are found mostly in the deserts, grasslands, and savannas of Africa; but they are also found in southwest and central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. They tend to live in herds, and eat fine, easily digestible plants and leaves. Gazelles are relatively small antelopes, most standing high at the shoulder, and are generally fawn-colored. The gazelle genera are Gazella, Eudorcas, and Nanger. The taxonomy of these genera is confused, and the classification of species and subspecies has been an unsettled issue. Currently, the genus Gazella is widely considered to contain about 10 species. One subspecies is extinct: the Queen of Sheba's gazelle. Most surviving gazelle species are considered threatened to varying degrees. Closely related to the true gazelles are the Tibetan goa and Mongolian gazelles (species of the genus Procapra), the blackbuck of Asia, and the African springbok. One widely familiar gazelle is the African species Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii), sometimes referred to as a "tommie". It is around in height at the shoulder and is coloured brown and white with a distinguishing black stripe. The males have long, often curved, horns. Like many other prey species, tommies exhibit a distinctive behaviour of stotting (running and jumping high before fleeing) when they are threatened by predators, such as cheetahs, lions, African wild dogs, crocodiles, hyenas, and leopards. ==Etymology and their name== Gazelle is derived from French gazelle, Old French gazel, probably via Old Spanish gacel, probably from North African pronunciation of , Maghrebi pronunciation . To Europe it first came to Old Spanish and Old French, and then around 1600 the word entered the English language. The Arab people traditionally hunted the gazelle. Later appreciated for its grace, however, it became a symbol most commonly associated in Arabic literature with human female beauty.Jokha Alharthi (PhD), (Sultan Qaboos University, College of Arts and Social Sciences - Arabic Department) https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288181275_The_Representation_of_the_Beloved's_Body_in_classical_Arabic_Poetry Note in particular pages 7 and 8 of this (linked-to) paper published at a conference in 2015. In many countries in Northwestern Sub-Saharan Africa, the gazelle is commonly referred to as "dangelo", meaning "swift deer". ==Symbolism or totemism in African families== The gazelle, like the antelope to which it is related, is the totem of many African families. Some examples include the Joof family of the Senegambia region,Faye, Louis Diène, Mort et naissance: le monde Sereer, Nouvelles Éditions africaines (1983), p. 74, the Bagananoa of Botswana in Southern Africa (said to be descended from the BaHurutshe), and the Eraraka (or Erarak) clan of Uganda.Roscoe, John, The Northern Bantu: An Account of Some Central African Tribes of the Uganda Protectorate, The University Press (1915), p. 262 As is common in many African societies, it is forbidden for the Joof or Eraraka to kill or touch the family totem. == Poetry == One of the traditional themes of Arabic love poetry involves comparing the gazelle with the beloved, and linguists theorize ghazal, the word for love poetry in Arabic, is related to the word for gazelle. It is related that the Caliph Abd al-Malik (646–705) freed a gazelle that he had captured because of her resemblance to his beloved: The theme is found in the ancient Hebrew Song of Songs. (8:14) ==Species== The gazelles are divided into three genera and numerous species.

The tiny Gazella borbonica is one of the earliest European gazelles, characterized by its small size and short legs. Gazelles disappeared from Europe at the start of the Ice Age, but they survived in Africa and Middle East. * Genus Gazella ** Gazella borbonica - Pleistocene Europe ** Gazella capricornis - Miocene Asia ** Gazella harmonae - Pliocene of Ethiopia, unusual spiral horns ** Gazella praethomsoni - Pliocene Africa ** Gazella negevensis - Early Miocene Asia ** Gazella thomasi - Thomas's gazelle ** Gazella vanhoepeni - Pliocene Africa * Subgenus Vetagazella ** Gazella altidens ** Gazella blacki - Pliocene Asia ** Gazella deperdita - Late Miocene Europe ** Gazella dorcadoides - Middle Miocene Asia ** Gazella pilgrimi - Late Miocene Europe ** Gazella gaudryi - Middle Miocene Eurasia ** Gazella kueitensis - Pliocene Asia ** Gazella lydekkeri - Mid to Late Miocene Asia ** Gazella paotehensis - Middle Miocene Asia ** Gazella paragutturosa - Pleistocene Asia ** Gazella parasinensis - Pliocene Asia ** Gazella praegaudryi - Pleistocene Africa ** Gazella sinensis - Pliocene Asia ** Gazella brianus - Pliocene Asia * Subgenus Gazella ** Gazella janenschi - Pliocene Africa * Subgenus Trachelocele ** Gazella atlantica - Pleistocene Africa ** Gazella tingitana - Pleistocene Africa * Subgenus Deprezia ** Gazella psolea - Pliocene Africa ==Gallery== File:Grants Gazelle Gazella granti in Tanzania 2645 Nevit.jpg|Grant's gazelle (male) File:Gazella dama mhorr 2.jpg|Mhorr gazelle File:Cuvier's Gazelle.jpg|Cuvier's gazelle (female) File:Gazella thomsonii - Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge, Orlando, Florida, USA - 20100916.jpg|Thomson's gazelle (male) File:Gazella spekei (Speke's Gazelle).jpg|Speke's gazelle (female) File:Group of Gazella subgutturosa.JPG|Goitered gazelle (females and young) File:Chinkara.jpg|Chinkara (female) File:Gazella-dorcas.jpg|Dorcas gazelle (female) File:Gazella rufifrons AB.jpg|Red-fronted gazelle File:Gazella gazella.jpg|Mountain gazelle (male) File:GazellaSoemmerringiWolf.jpg|Soemmerring's gazelle (females) File:Slender- horned gazelle (Cincinnati Zoo).jpg|Slender-horned gazelle (male) File:Granada Alhambra gazelle Poterie 9019.JPG|Gazelles on one of the vases made for the Alhambra palace ==References== ==External links== * Category:Mammals of Africa Category:True antelopes Category:Extant Pliocene first appearances Category:Taxa named by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville .
