thumb|A one-horse chaise thumb|A three-wheeled "Handchaise", Germany, around 1900, designed to be pushed by a person A chaise ( ), sometimes called chay or shay, is a light two- or four-wheeled traveling or pleasure carriage for one or two people with a folding hood or calash top. The name, in use in England before 1700, came from the French word "chaise" (meaning "chair") through a transference from a sedan-chair to a wheeled vehicle. == Design == The two- wheeled version, usually of a chair-backed type, for one or two persons, also called a gig or one-horse shay, had a body hung on leather straps or thorough- braces and was usually drawn by one horse; a light chaise having two seats was a double chair. A chaise-cart was a light carriage fitted with suspension, used for transporting lightweight goods. A bath chair was a hooded and sometimes glassed wheeled chair used especially by invalids; it could be drawn by a horse or pushed by an attendant. Other types of chaise included: * post chaise : designed for fast long-distance travel * curricle: two-wheeled, usually drawn by two horses * cales√≠n: small, one-horse, hooded, a seat behind for the driver, used in the Philippines * shandrydan or shandradan: with a hood During the winter of 1791/92, in the opening phases of the French Revolution, Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough, noted the lack of ostentation in the streets of Paris, where a few drove themselves about in "little open chaises like the cabriolet but with one horse."Janet Gleeson, Privilege and Scandal: The Remarkable Life of Harriet Spencer, Sister of Georgiana 2006:130. ==See also == Post chaise == References == Category:Carriages .
