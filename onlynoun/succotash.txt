Succotash (from Narragansett sahquttahhash, "broken corn kernels"Trumbull (1903). Entry for *msickquatash (p. 67; archive p. n194): (Narr.) n.pl. 'boiled corn whole' (i.e. mo-soquttahhash, not broken small or pounded?). See soh-quttahham. When broken, soquttahhash without the prefix. Hence the common name succotash, improperly applied, however, to the unbroken corn.) is a vegetable dish consisting primarily of sweet corn with lima beans or other shell beans. Other ingredients may be added, such as onions, potatoes, turnips, tomatoes, bell peppers, corned beef, salt pork, or okra. Combining a grain with a legume provides a dish that is high in all essential amino acids. == History == Succotash has a long history. An invention of the Indigenous peoples in whatâ€™s now known as New England, foreign colonists adapted the dish as a stew in the 17th century. Composed of ingredients unknown in Europe at the time, it gradually became a standard meal in the cuisine of New England(Paywall) and is a traditional dish of many Thanksgiving celebrations in the region,Morgan, Diane and John Rizzo. The Thanksgiving Table: Recipes and Ideas to Create Your Own Holiday Tradition. Pg. 122. as well as in Pennsylvania and other states. Because of the relatively inexpensive and more readily available ingredients, the dish was popular during the Great Depression in the United States. It was sometimes cooked in a casserole form, often with a light pie crust on top as in a traditional pot pie. == Recipes == Sweet corn (a form of maize), American beans, tomatoes, and peppers (all New World foods) are the usual ingredients. Catherine Beecher's 19th-century recipe includes beans boiled with corn cobs from which the kernels have been removed. The kernels are added later, after the beans have boiled for several hours. The corn cobs are removed and the finished stew, in proportions of 2 parts corn to 1 part beans, is thickened with flour. Henry Ward Beecher's recipe, published in an 1846 issue of Western Farmer and Gardner, adds salt pork, which he says is "an essential part of the affair." In some parts of the American South, any mixture of vegetables prepared with lima beans and topped with lard or butter is considered succotash. ==In popular culture== * Sylvester the Cat's and Daffy Duck's trademark exclamations are "Sufferin' succotash!" ==See also== * A Key into the Language of America * List of legume dishes * List of maize dishes * List of regional dishes of the United States * Umngqusho, a similar dish from Southern Africa ==References== == Further reading == * == External links == * Category:Narragansett tribe Category:Native American cuisine Category:Legume dishes Category:Dishes featuring sweet corn Category:National dishes Category:Okra dishes Category:Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies Category:Vegetarian cuisine .
