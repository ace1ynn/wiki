A jar is a rigid, cylindrical or slightly conical container, typically made of glass, ceramic, or plastic, with a wide mouth or opening that can be closed with a lid, screw cap, lug cap, cork stopper, roll-on cap, crimp-on cap, press-on cap, plastic shrink, heat sealed lidding film, an inner seal, a tamper-evident band, or other suitable means. ==Etymology== The English word "jar" originates from the Arabic word jarra, which means an earthen pot or vessel. == Creation == Jars are sterilised by putting them in a pressure cooker with boiling water or an oven for a number of minutes. Glass jars are considered microwavable. == Utility == Jars can be used to hold solids too large to be removed from, or liquids too viscous to be poured through a bottle's neck; these may be foods, cosmetics, medications, or chemicals.Yam, K. L., "Encyclopedia of Packaging Technology", John Wiley & Sons, 2009, Glass jars—among which the most popular is the mason jar—can be used for storing and preserving items as diverse as jam, pickled gherkin, other pickles, marmalade, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, jalapeño peppers, chutneys, pickled eggs, honey, and many others. == Types == * Bell jar - typically used in scientific laboratories to produce a vacuum; also used in Victorian times for display purposes * Cookie jar - typically ceramic or glass, common in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom * Killing jar - used to kill captured insects * Leyden jar - a historical electrical capacitor * Specimen jar - an instrument used in anatomy to preserve specimens * Apothecary jar - historically for storage of medicines; made of ceramics or more typically in modern centuries, clear glass. Typically cylindrical or with rotationally symmetric decorative curves, sometimes with a glass disc foot separated from the main body. Modern glass versions are also used for artistic display of the contents. Modern glass food storage jars come in a variety of shapes, all of which have a circular opening on top for screwing on a lid: * Economy round or wide mouth jars - tall but rotund cylinder slightly rounded at the top and bottom, relatively wide with a wide mouth, commonly used for sauces like a mayonnaise * Paragon jars - tall and narrow cylinder, commonly used for pickled foods like olives * French square or Victorian jars - roughly a small cube * Spice jars - small cylinder or rectangular cuboid * Hexagon or hex jars - regular hexagonal prism * Mason jars - moderately tall cylinder typically used in home canning, sealed with a metal lid * Kilner jar - similar to a Mason jar but sealed with rubber * Straight-sided jars - cylinders with no neck. Squat straight-sided jars are suitable for creams which can be scooped out. Ancient ceramic types include: * Amphora - large, but typically holding under 50 L * Pithos - very large, typically the size of a person and holding hundreds of liters ==Gallery== File:PreservedFood1.jpg|Preserved food in Mason jars File:Jam jar.jpg|Reusable jam jar with flip-top or bail closure File:Jar made of PLA-Blend Bio-Flex.jpg|Jar made of PLA-blend bio-flex, a bioplastic File:CandyJaracp.png|Candy jar File:HK Central Kai Bo Foods Buddy's 花生醬 Peanut creamy Butter Skippy April-2012.JPG|Peanut butter File:Orzas in Spain.jpg|Six types of "earthenware jar" in Spain File:Brown-glazed Jar with Design of Three Fish.
