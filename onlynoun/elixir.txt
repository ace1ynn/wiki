thumb|Advertisement for Elixir d'Anvers An elixir is a sweet liquid used for medical purposes, to be taken orally and intended to cure one's illness. When used as a pharmaceutical preparation, an elixir contains at least one active ingredient designed to be taken orally. ==Etymology== The word was introduced in late Middle English, through Latin from Arabic al-ʾiksīr (الإكسير), which in turn is the Arabization of Greek xērion (ξήριον) "powder for drying wounds" (from ξηρός xēros "dry"). For centuries elixir primarily meant an ingredient used in alchemy, either referring to a liquid which purportedly converts lead to gold, or a substance or liquid which is believed to cure all ills and give eternal life. ==Types== === Non-medicated elixirs === These are used as solvents or vehicles for the preparation of medicated elixirs. Active ingredients are dissolved in a 15–⁠50% by volume solution of ethyl alcohol: *aromatic elixirs (USP) *isoalcoholic elixirs (NF) *compound benzaldehyde elixirs (NF) === Medicated elixirs === These include: * antihistaminic elixirs used against allergy, such as chlorpheniramine maleate (USP) or diphenhydramine HCl * sedative and hypnotic elixirs, the former to induce drowsiness, the latter to induce sleep *pediatric elixirs such as chloral hydrate *expectorant elixirs used to facilitate productive cough (i.e. cough with sputum), such as terpin hydrate === East Asian vitamin drinks === Daily non-alcoholic non-caffeinated 'vitamin drinks' have been popular in East Asia since the 1950s, with Oronamin from Otsuka Pharmaceutical perhaps the market leader. Packaged in brown light-proof bottles, these drinks have the reputation of being enjoyed by old men and other health-conscious individuals. Counterparts exist in South Korea and China. Western energy drinks typically have caffeine and are targeted at a younger demographic, with colorful labels and printed claims of increased athletic/daily performance. ===Pseudomedicinal drinks=== See patent medicine ==Composition== thumb|Poster for Elixir Mondet, 1899 An elixir is a hydro-alcoholic solution of at least one active ingredient.
