Major (commandant in certain jurisdictions) is a military rank of commissioned officer status, with corresponding ranks existing in many armed forces throughout the world. When used unhyphenated and in conjunction with no other indicators, major is one rank above captain in armies and air forces, and one rank below lieutenant colonel. It is considered the most junior of the field officer ranks. ==Background== Majors are typically assigned as specialised executive or operations officers for battalion-sized units of 300 to 1,200 soldiers while in some nations, like Germany, majors are often in command of a company. When used in hyphenated or combined fashion, the term can also imply seniority at other levels of rank, including general-major or major general, denoting a low-level general officer, and sergeant major, denoting the most senior non-commissioned officer (NCO) of a military unit. The term major can also be used with a hyphen to denote the leader of a military band such as in pipe-major or drum-major. Historically, the rank designation developed in English in the 1640s, taken from French majeur, in turn a shortening of sergent-majeur, which at the time designated a higher rank than at present. The term Mayor for the head of a municipal government can also be traced to the same French word. The rank of major is also used in some police forces and other paramilitary rank structures, such as the Pennsylvania State Police, New York State Police, New Jersey State Police, and several others. As with a military major, this rank is most commonly the next rank above captain. The rank is equivalent to an inspector or commander in other large police departments or to the UK rank of superintendent. ==Links to major ranks by country== Alphabetically sorted by name of country: * Major (Canada) * Major (France) * Major (Germany) * Major (Sri Lanka) * Major (Sweden) * Major (United Kingdom) * Major (United States) ==Insignia== ===Insignia of army majors=== File:ALB-Army-OF-3.svg| File:Australian Army OF-3.svg| File:Bangladesh-army-OF-3.svg| File:Army-BEL-OF-03.svg| File:Bosnia and Herzegovina Major Insignia.svg| File:Major Exército-V.gif| File:Rank insignia of mayor of the Colombian Army.svg| File:Army-HRV-OF-03.svg| File:Cdn-Army- Maj(OF-3)-2014 - Copy.svg| File:CzArmy 2011 OF3-Major shoulder.svg| File:Rank insignia of major of the Royal Danish Army.svg| File:Mayorwikifixed.svg| File:EgyptianArmyInsignia-Major.svg| File:ES-Army-OF3.png| File:Majuri kauluslaatta.svg| File:Army-FRA-OF-03.svg| File:Georgia Army OF-4.png| File:HD H 51 Major FJg.svg| File:Army-GRE-OF-03.svg| File:Rank Army Hungary OF-03.svg| File:IFRmajor.PNG| File:Major of the Indian Army.svg| File:16-TNI Army- MAJ.svg| File:IDF rav seren.svg| File:Sargord.png| File:IT-Army-OF3.svg| File:Major of Malaysian Army.png| File:Nl-landmacht-majoor.svg| File:Nigeria- Army-OF-3.svg| File:Army-NOR-OF-03.svg| File:OF-3 Pakistan Army.svg| File:PA MAJ Svc.svg| File:Army-POL-OF-03.svg| File:16 - Major.svg| File:RO-Army- OF3.png| File:Russia-Army-OF-3-2010.svg| File:12-Serbian_Army-MAJ.svg| File:04-RSA-OF03.svg| File:11-Somali Army-MAJ.svg| File:SAA-OF-3.svg| File:Spain-Army-OF-3.svg| File:OF-3 Major.jpg| File:CHE OF3 Maj.svg| File:Taiwan-army-OF-3.svg| File:RTA OF-3 (Major).svg| File:Turkey-army- OF-3.svg| File:UA shoulder mark 15.svg| File:British Army OF-3.svg| File:US Army O4 (Army greens).svg| ===Insignia of air force majors=== File:Fuerza Aerea Argentina - Mayor.svg| File:Major-vertical fab.gif| File:RNAF Maj.svg| File:Naramenica službene odore bojnika HRZ i PZO.svg| File:RDAF Maj.svg| File:Georgia Air Force OF-4.png| File:LD B 51 Major.svg| File:16-TNI Air Force-MAJ.svg| File:IDF rav seren silver-2.svg| File:IT-Airforce-OF-3.png| File:Mayor FAM.GIF| File:PAF MAJ Svc.svg| File:Major Lotnicze.png| File:Major t.jpg| File:Russia-Airforce-OF-3-2010.svg| File:OF-3 Major FV hylsa.jpg| File:Turkey-air-force-OF-3.svg File:US Air Force O4 shoulderboard.svg| ===Insignia of naval infantry majors=== File:IDF rav seren gold-2.svg| File:PHIL ARMY MAJ WOODLAND.svg| File:OF-3 Major AMF hylsa.jpg| File:British Royal Marines OF-3.svg| File:US Marine O4 shoulderboard vertical.svg| File:16-TNI Navy-LCDR.svg| ===Insignia of majors of other services=== File:US Space-force O4 (interim).svg|United States Space Force ==See also== *List of comparative military ranks ==References== Category:Military ranks .
