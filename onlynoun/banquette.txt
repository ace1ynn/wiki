A banquette is a small footpath or elevated step along the inside of a rampart or parapet of a fortification. Musketeers atop it were able to view the counterscarp, or fire on enemies in the moat. A typical size is a foot and a half (approximately half a metre) high, and almost three feet (approximately 90 cm) wide. ==See also== * List of established military terms ==References== * Category:Castle architecture .
